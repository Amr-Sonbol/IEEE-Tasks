Task #1 Explain How The Web Works ? and Explain What is “client server model”? .

How the web works: 
When you type or click a URL into your browser, The browser goes to the DNS (Domain Name System) server,DNS checks the IP address for the server that hosts your website. 

The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.

Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers "google" of a resource or service called servers, and service requesters "users" called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests.Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, and the World Wide Web.
